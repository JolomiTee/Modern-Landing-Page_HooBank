# HooBank - A modern bank landing page 
This is my first React tutorial project made by the creators of the JavaScriptMastery YouTube Channel. I took interest in the video when I saw that it was beginner friendly, so I hoped it would further my knowledge of both frontend frameworks used to create it [React.js and Tailwindcss].
It is a modern looking, beautiful and responsive landing page which aims to catch the eyes with stunning visual gradients, beautiful texts and an overall amazing layout. 
## Live Demo of Hoobank is [here](https://hoobank-dkt9.onrender.com/)
### Cloning the project to your local environment?
Here are the steps to do that:
* Copy the repository url which can be found in the code button above the file view.
* Open up your terminal or how I prefer it, your favourite Code Editor Terminal
* Create a new directory wherever you prefer and move into that directory with ```cd <directory name>```
* Run the command ```git clone <repo url>``` to clone the repository to your local machine
* Open the folder with the command ```code .```
* When the folder is open and you can see the file structure, open a new terminal in your editor and run ```npm install``` to install all npm dependencies
* When dependencies are installed, you can now run the view of the project using the command ```npm.run dev``` which will open a local port that displays the site.
* Don't forget to ENJOY!
